If something wrong with `npm install`:
rm -rf node_modules
npm install -g npm@latest
npm i core-util-is

If something like c++ wrong. with libc++...:
env C=clang CXX=clang++ npm install

If something like 'Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.

Check the render method of `Provider`.' happens,
A solution suggested by Victor Nunes is to:

Delete the package-lock.json file and the node_modules folder
Remove all content of "dependencies" on package.json
Run npm install --save react react-dom react-redux react-scripts redux
npm i browserslist@4.6.3
